# Kugel

Stop noodling with `jq`.  Explore Kubernetes resources using SQLite.

## Example

Find the top users of a GPU pool, based on instance type and a team-specific pod label.

With Kugel

```shell
kugel -a "select owner, sum(gpu_req), sum(cpu_req)
          from pods join nodes on pods.node_name = nodes.name
          where instance_type = 'a40' and pods.status in ('Running', 'Terminating')
          group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 10"
```

Without Kugel

```shell
nodes=$(kubectl get nodes -o json | jq '[.items[] 
        | select(.metadata.labels["beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type"] == "a40") | .metadata.name]')
kubectl get pods -o json --all-namespaces | jq -r --argjson nodes "$nodes" '
  [ .items[]
  | select(.spec.nodeName as $node | $nodes | index($node))
  | select(.status.phase == "Running" or 
           (.metadata.deletionTimestamp != null and .status.phase != "Succeeded" and .status.phase != "Failed"))
  | . as $pod | $pod.spec.containers[]
  | select(.resources.requests["nvidia.com/gpu"] != null)
  | {owner: $pod.metadata.labels["com.mycompany/job-owner"], 
     gpu: .resources.requests["nvidia.com/gpu"], 
     cpu: .resources.requests["cpu"]}
  ] | group_by(.owner) 
  | map({owner: .[0].owner, 
         gpu: map(.gpu | tonumber) | add, 
         cpu: map(.cpu | if test("m$") then (sub("m$"; "") | tonumber / 1000) else tonumber end) | add})
  | sort_by(-.gpu) | .[:10]
  | "\(.gpu) \(.cpu) \(.owner)"'

```

## Installing

Kugel requires Python 3.9 or later, and kubectl.

**This is an alpha release.**  Please expect bugs and backward-incompatible changes.

To use via docker, `mkdir ~/.kugel` then use this Bash alias:

```shell
kugel() {
    docker run \
        -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube \
        -v ~/.kugel:/root/.kugel \
        jonross/kugel:0.2.0 python3 -m kugel.main "$@"
}
```

If neither of those works for you, it's easy to set up from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jonross/kugel.git
cd kugel
make deps
PATH=${PATH}:$(pwd)/bin
```

### Test it

Report available and unavailable node counts, by instance type and taints.

```shell
kugel "with t as (select name, group_concat(key) as taints from node_taints
                  where effect in ('NoSchedule', 'NoExecute') group by 1)
       select instance_type, count(1), taints
       from nodes left outer join t on t.node_name = nodes.name
       group by 1, 3 order by 1, 2 desc"
```

If this query is helpful, [save it](./docs-tmp/shortcuts.md), then you can run `kugel nodes`.

## How it works (important)

Kugel is just a thin wrapper on Kubectl and SQLite.  It turns `SELECT ... FROM pods` into 
`kubectl get pods -o json`, then maps fields from the response to columns
in SQLite.  If you `JOIN` to other resource tables like `nodes` it calls `kubectl get`
for those too.  If you need more columns or tables than are built in, there's a config file for that.

Because Kugel always fetches all resources from a namespace (or everything, if 
`-a/--all-namespaces` is used), it tries
to ease Kubernetes API Server load by **caching responses for 
two minutes**.  This is why it often prints "Data delayed up to ..." messages.

Depending on your cluster activity, the cache can be a help or a hindrance.
You can suppress the "delayed" messages with the `-r` / `--reckless` option, or
always update data using the `-u` / `--update` option.  These behaviors, and
the cache expiration time, can be set in the config file as well.

In any case, please be mindful of stale data and server load.

## Rationale

`jq` is awesome, but... can you join and group without looking at the manual? Can you do math on non-numeric
data like "500Mi" of memory or "200m" CPUs or "2024-11-01T12:34:56Z"?  Can you determine the STATUS of a pod
the way `kubectl get pods` does?

Probably not.  Kugel can help.

Prior art (as of November 2024)

* [ksql](https://github.com/brendandburns/ksql) is built on Node.js and AlaSQL.  It appears unmaintained (last commit November 2016.)
* [kubeql](https://github.com/saracen/kubeql) is a SQL-like query language for Kubernetes. It appears unmaintained (last commit October 2017.)
* [kube-query](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-query) is an [osquery](https://osquery.io/) extension. It appears unmaintained (last commit July 2020) and requires recompilation to add columns or tables.
* [cyphernetes](https://github.com/AvitalTamir/cyphernetes) is in active development and looks viable, but it uses Cypher (a graph query language) and I'd like SQL.

Kugel hopes to be minimalist and immediately familiar.
SQLite ships with Python, and if you're reading this you have `kubectl`, so let's build on those.
